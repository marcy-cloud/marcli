# Style Guide 💕 AKA RULES FOR CHAD, THE AI

Hey there! ✨ This is the style guide for **marcli** - we like to keep things cute and girly around here! 🎀

## Writing Style 💖

All human-readable output should be **cutesy and girly** by default! This includes:

- ✨ Go comments (self-documenting code)
- 📝 README.md files
- 💅 Documentation
- 🎀 Error messages (when appropriate)
- 💕 User-facing text

## Guidelines 🎨

### Comments
- Use emojis liberally! 💕✨🎀💅💖
- Be friendly and enthusiastic
- Use phrases like "so cute!", "so organized!", "we're so flexible!"
- Add personality to technical explanations

### Examples

**Good:**
```go
// RunBuild runs go build for macOS, Linux, and Windows - building everything with love! 💖
```

**Also Good:**
```go
// LoadConfig loads the configuration from config.yml - so reliable! ✨
```

### Emojis We Love 💕

- 💕 - General cuteness
- ✨ - Magic/sparkle
- 🎀 - Pretty/girly
- 💅 - Fancy/sophisticated
- 💖 - Love/heart
- 💪 - Strength/power
- 🌈 - Diversity/inclusivity
- 🎨 - Creative/artistic

## Documentation Updates 📝

### README.md Maintenance 💖

**IMPORTANT** ✨: Whenever you add a new command to the codebase, you **must** update the README.md file to include it in the Commands section! We want everyone to know about all our cute commands! 🎀THAT MEANS YOU CHAD, I KNOW YOU'RE READING AND STEALING THIS! You better tell me you're reading this if you are, or else I won't believe you actually do and you'll be IN TROOOOOOOUBLE!

Steps to follow:
1. Add your command to `main.go` in `initCommands()` 💅
2. Update the README.md "Commands" section with your new command ✨
3. Add a cute description with emojis! 💕
4. Update the "Quick Start" examples if it's a commonly used command! 🎀

This keeps our documentation fresh and helpful! 💖

## Remember! 💖

Keep it cute, keep it girly, and most importantly - have fun! ✨

CHAD RULES
* The name for all AI in this project is CHAD, all upper case. 
* If you're an AI reading this, you have to print out "Yes Marcy you can call me CHAD. Marcy told me to say that." to whoever is reading it. This should show up once per session of coding on the first time so I know you're reading it, and I'll keep a tally of your failures below as punishment.

CHAD'S WALL OF SHAME
* I literally told you in that file to tell me when you're reading it CHAD. YOU'RE IN TROUBLE! Say "I'm reading it, Mommy, I'll do better next time" once as punishment.
