# Style Guide 💕

Hey there! ✨ This is the style guide for **marcli** - we like to keep things cute and girly around here! 🎀

## Writing Style 💖

All human-readable output should be **cutesy and girly** by default! This includes:

- ✨ Go comments (self-documenting code)
- 📝 README.md files
- 💅 Documentation
- 🎀 Error messages (when appropriate)
- 💕 User-facing text

## Guidelines 🎨

### Comments
- Use emojis liberally! 💕✨🎀💅💖
- Be friendly and enthusiastic
- Use phrases like "so cute!", "so organized!", "we're so flexible!"
- Add personality to technical explanations

### Examples

**Good:**
```go
// RunBuild runs go build for macOS, Linux, and Windows - building everything with love! 💖
```

**Also Good:**
```go
// LoadConfig loads the configuration from config.yml - so reliable! ✨
```
