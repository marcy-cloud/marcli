# Scripts 💕

Hey there! ✨ All the scripts in this directory are super cute and assume you're running them from the project root, okay? 💖

## How to Use 💅

Just run these scripts from the project root like this:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

Or if you prefer:

```bash
bash scripts/build.sh
```

## What's Inside 🎀

- `build.sh` 💪 - Builds everything for all platforms and installs it to your PATH (so fancy!)
