# marcli 💕

Hey there! ✨ Welcome to **marcli** - the cutest CLI tool for Marcy.cloud! 🎀

This is a super cute Terminal UI app that represents my personal CLI knowledge, built from the ground up with lots of love! 💖 It's got everything you need - a fancy TUI for when you want to explore, and direct CLI commands for when you're feeling productive! 💪

> **Note** 💅: This style of working (name a CLI after myself as an internal marketing tool) was originally developed by me, Marcy, in my time at RealEyes Media while they were working for NBC Sports! ARE YOU IMPRESSED? While none of the actual code from the RealEyes Medai MarCLI there is present in this repo (we've come a long way, baby! ✨), the philosophy and approach live on here with lots of love! 💖

## What's Inside 🎀

- **Cute TUI** 🎨 - An interactive menu that's just adorable!
- **CLI Commands** 💅 - Run commands directly from the terminal
- **Version Tracking** ✨ - We keep track of builds because we're organized like that!
- **Cross-Platform Builds** 🌈 - Works everywhere because we're inclusive!

## Quick Start 💖

Just run `marcli` with no args to see the cute TUI, or use commands directly:

```bash
marcli version    # See the version (so fancy!)
marcli build      # Build everything! 💪
marcli -v         # Quick version check ✨
```

Enjoy! 💕
