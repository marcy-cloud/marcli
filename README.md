# marcli 💕

Hey there! ✨ Welcome to **marcli** - the cutest CLI tool for Marcy.cloud! 🎀

This is a super cute Terminal UI app that represents my personal CLI knowledge, built from the ground up with lots of love! 💖 It's got everything you need - a fancy TUI for when you want to explore, and direct CLI commands for when you're feeling productive! 💪

## What's Inside 🎀

- **Cute TUI** 🎨 - An interactive menu that's just adorable!
- **CLI Commands** 💅 - Run commands directly from the terminal
- **Version Tracking** ✨ - We keep track of builds because we're organized like that!
- **Cross-Platform Builds** 🌈 - Works everywhere because we're inclusive!

## Quick Start 💖

Just run `marcli` with no args to see the cute TUI, or use commands directly:

```bash
marcli version    # See the version (so fancy!)
marcli build      # Build everything! 💪
marcli -v         # Quick version check ✨
```

Enjoy! 💕
